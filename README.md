# Crypto Pump and Dump Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing historical cryptocurrency data to detect potential pump and dump events. The detection algorithm considers price and trading volume changes, along with a customizable moving average window. The notebook uses data from the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentation/v3).

**Note**: This analysis was generated using OpenAI's ChatGPT, an AI language model.

## Features

- Analyzes historical data for any cryptocurrency available on CoinGecko.
- Considers price and trading volume changes to identify potential pump and dump events.
- Customizable threshold parameters and moving average window.
- Generates a plot of the cryptocurrency's price history with detected pump and dump events.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Requests

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-pump-and-dump-detection.git
```

2. Change the `coin_id` variable in the Jupyter Notebook to the desired cryptocurrency's CoinGecko ID (e.g., "bitcoin" for Bitcoin).

3. Adjust the `price_threshold`, `volume_threshold`, and `moving_average_window` variables in the notebook to fine-tune the detection of pump and dump events.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to analyze the historical data and visualize the results.
